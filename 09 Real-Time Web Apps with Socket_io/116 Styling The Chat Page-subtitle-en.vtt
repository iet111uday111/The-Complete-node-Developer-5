00:00.180 --> 00:03.090
In this video you're finally going to get some styles in place.

00:03.090 --> 00:09.140
So our app looks a little less like an ANS tiled h DML page and a little more like a real web app.

00:09.180 --> 00:13.770
Now on the left we have this people panel we're not going to be wiring that up yet although we are giving

00:13.770 --> 00:15.700
it a place inside of our page.

00:15.720 --> 00:20.520
Eventually this is going to store a list of all the people connected to the individual chat room that's

00:20.520 --> 00:24.810
going to come a bit later over here the main area is going to be the messages panel.

00:24.810 --> 00:27.290
Now the individual messages are still on styled.

00:27.300 --> 00:28.580
That's going to come later.

00:28.650 --> 00:34.290
But we do have a place to put all of that stuff Dambulla we have our footer This includes our form for

00:34.290 --> 00:36.920
sending a message the text box and the button.

00:36.990 --> 00:41.120
And that also includes our send location button sitting right here.

00:41.250 --> 00:46.490
Now to get all of this done we're going to add a CSSA template that I've created for this project.

00:46.530 --> 00:49.580
We're also going to be adding some classes to our HDMI.

00:49.590 --> 00:52.260
All this is going to let us apply the various styles.

00:52.260 --> 00:58.050
And finally we'll be making a few small tweaks to our javascript to improve the user experience.

00:58.050 --> 01:04.650
Let's go ahead and Diven the first thing we're going to do is make a new folder and a new file to store

01:04.650 --> 01:05.550
our styles.

01:05.550 --> 01:08.800
This is going to be the template styles will be grabbing in just a moment.

01:08.910 --> 01:11.840
Then we're going to go ahead and load it into index dot HD.

01:11.940 --> 01:14.810
So those styles are used when we render the chat app.

01:15.060 --> 01:19.140
Now the first thing we're going to do is create a new folder inside of public and we're going to call

01:19.140 --> 01:23.370
this folder CSSA and we're going to add just one file to it.

01:23.550 --> 01:27.410
A new file called styles dot C Ss.

01:27.450 --> 01:33.480
Now before we go off and grab any styles Let's go ahead and import this file into our application.

01:33.630 --> 01:38.520
And in order to test and make sure that's working what we're going to do is write a very simple selector.

01:38.730 --> 01:44.670
We're going to select everything using the star than inside of curly braces we're going to add a style

01:45.600 --> 01:48.600
setting the color for everything equal to red.

01:48.600 --> 01:51.000
Go ahead and make your file just like this one.

01:51.000 --> 01:55.600
We're going to save that and then we'll import it over inside of index dot each time M.

01:55.830 --> 02:01.840
Right here at the bottom of the head tag below are met a tag we're going to add a link tag.

02:01.860 --> 02:07.470
This is going to let us link a style sheet we have to provide two attributes to get that done.

02:07.470 --> 02:14.070
First off we have to tell HVM exactly what we're linking to by specifying the RTL or relation attribute.

02:14.130 --> 02:17.400
In this case we're trying to link a stylesheet.

02:17.500 --> 02:20.250
So we're going to provide that as the value.

02:20.260 --> 02:23.560
Now the next thing we need to do is provide the ref attribute.

02:23.590 --> 02:26.830
This is similar to the source attribute for the script tag.

02:26.890 --> 02:29.690
It's the path to the file you want to link.

02:29.830 --> 02:35.230
In this case we have that at forward slash CSSA and we just created the file styles.

02:35.410 --> 02:38.410
Success forward slash styles.

02:38.470 --> 02:45.010
Dot C-s that's with this in place we can save index dot h TNL and give our page a refresh over inside

02:45.010 --> 02:47.370
of the browser or load it up for the very first time.

02:47.410 --> 02:49.990
And what we see is a hideously ugly page.

02:49.990 --> 02:55.630
We've managed to make it even uglier than it was previously but this is great because it means our stylesheet

02:55.660 --> 03:00.480
file is getting imported correctly now in order to grab the actual template.

03:00.490 --> 03:02.380
We're going to be using for the chat app.

03:02.380 --> 03:10.750
We're going to visit a u r l h t t p colon forward slash forward slash length's dot Meade dot IO my

03:10.750 --> 03:14.690
site forward slash chat hyphen CSSA.

03:14.770 --> 03:18.630
This is just a bit like length that's going to redirect you over to a jest.

03:18.730 --> 03:22.990
And here we have two options we can grab either the minute style template or the.

03:23.030 --> 03:27.820
UNIDENTIFIED one I'm gonna go ahead and grab this minute one by either highlighting it or clicking this

03:27.820 --> 03:30.680
raw link which brings us to the file.

03:30.880 --> 03:33.220
We're going to grab the entire contents we see here.

03:33.370 --> 03:37.740
Head over into Adam and paste it inside of our CSSA file.

03:37.850 --> 03:40.520
Removing obviously the previous selector.

03:40.720 --> 03:41.580
Perfect.

03:41.800 --> 03:45.610
Now that we had this in place we can give our page a refresh although we're not really going to see

03:45.610 --> 03:49.090
much improvement over inside of localhost 3000.

03:49.120 --> 03:53.350
I'll give the browser a refresh and clearly things are different but it doesn't look anything like that

03:53.350 --> 03:56.070
screen shot we had in the beginning of this video.

03:56.120 --> 04:02.950
That is because we need to apply some classes to our DML in order to get everything to work correctly.

04:02.950 --> 04:08.920
We're also going to need to tweak the structure adding a few container elements to help with alignment

04:09.340 --> 04:12.750
over inside out and we can get this done in just a few minutes.

04:13.990 --> 04:20.710
This template was built around a few key classes the first one needs to get applied to the body by setting

04:20.710 --> 04:26.040
the class attribute equal to inside of quotes chat.

04:26.140 --> 04:31.540
This tells the style sheet to load the styles for this chat page and we're going to go ahead and remove.

04:31.540 --> 04:32.860
Welcome to the chat app.

04:32.860 --> 04:35.160
This is no longer necessary.

04:35.200 --> 04:39.970
Now the next thing we're going to do is create a div and this div is going to house that people list

04:40.000 --> 04:41.850
we saw on the left hand side.

04:41.950 --> 04:44.140
It's going to be empty for the moment but that's fine.

04:44.140 --> 04:47.440
We can still go ahead and create it right here.

04:47.470 --> 04:48.430
We're going to make a div

04:52.030 --> 04:57.790
and we're going to give this div a class and that class is going to get set equal to the following chat

04:58.210 --> 05:02.390
underscore underscore that's two underscores side bar.

05:02.680 --> 05:06.460
This is a naming convention used in some style sheet templates.

05:06.460 --> 05:07.780
It's really a matter of preference.

05:07.780 --> 05:10.640
You could call this whatever you want when you create the style sheet.

05:10.660 --> 05:14.550
I happen to call it chat underscore underscore sidebar.

05:14.590 --> 05:18.920
It's a sub element inside of the greater chat app.

05:19.150 --> 05:25.180
Now inside of here we're going to add a little title using the header three tag we're going to give

05:25.180 --> 05:29.000
this a title of people or whatever you want to call that side bar list.

05:29.010 --> 05:34.420
And we're also going to provide a div which will eventually house the individual users although as I

05:34.420 --> 05:37.150
mentioned we're not going to be wiring that up yet.

05:37.180 --> 05:42.890
Now we can go ahead and give this an I.D. setting it equal to users so we can target it a bit later.

05:42.970 --> 05:46.360
And that's all we need for the chat sidebar at the moment.

05:46.360 --> 05:52.440
Now the next thing that we're going to do is create a div and that this debt is going to house that

05:52.440 --> 05:57.810
main area which means it's going to contain not only our chat messages but also the little form at the

05:57.810 --> 06:01.470
bottom everything on the right hand side of the sidewalk.

06:01.740 --> 06:05.210
This also is going to require a custom class for some styles.

06:05.220 --> 06:11.050
This one is called Chat underscore underscore Maine and inside of here we're going to add not only are

06:11.070 --> 06:14.410
unordered lists but also our form and button.

06:14.460 --> 06:19.930
Let's go ahead and take all of our current markup the unordered list down to the send location button.

06:19.950 --> 06:23.500
Cut it out and paste it inside of chat main.

06:23.520 --> 06:24.680
Now we're not quite done yet.

06:24.690 --> 06:26.520
There are a few more things to tweak.

06:26.520 --> 06:29.680
First up we have to add a class to our ordered list.

06:31.670 --> 06:34.730
We'll set the class equal to chat messages.

06:34.730 --> 06:39.770
This is going to provide the necessary styles and the last div we need to create is going to be for

06:39.770 --> 06:40.550
that FOTR.

06:40.610 --> 06:46.250
This is going to be the gray bar at the bottom that contains both your form as well as the send location

06:46.310 --> 06:47.320
button.

06:47.420 --> 06:50.820
We're going to make a div which is going to help with alignment.

06:51.020 --> 06:56.870
And we're going to add the form and the button inside of it by kind of get out and pasting it right

06:56.870 --> 06:58.040
in here.

06:58.040 --> 07:02.480
Now we are going to need to add a class here too as you might have guessed setting the class attribute

07:02.480 --> 07:03.820
equal to the string.

07:03.920 --> 07:07.220
Chat underscore underscore footer.

07:07.250 --> 07:11.120
Now we have all of our classes in place and we can head over to the browser and see what we get when

07:11.120 --> 07:15.680
we give the page a refresh what we get is something a little similar to what we had previously.

07:15.740 --> 07:17.880
But obviously there are some notable differences.

07:17.900 --> 07:20.490
The footer is not quite rendering correctly.

07:20.660 --> 07:27.410
If we head back over into ADOM we can take a look at just why right here we have a div this div has

07:27.410 --> 07:30.650
a class of chapt footer but class was spelt wrong.

07:30.680 --> 07:33.230
All I have to do is go ahead and fix that typo.

07:33.290 --> 07:35.510
Give the browser a refreshed one more time.

07:35.510 --> 07:38.280
And now we're getting the complete picture.

07:38.300 --> 07:43.520
We have our styled chat application and we can still do whatever we were able to do before I can send

07:43.520 --> 07:47.780
off a message hey this should still work.

07:47.810 --> 07:48.440
Hit enter.

07:48.530 --> 07:51.640
And hey this should still work shows up to the screen.

07:51.770 --> 07:53.620
The same thing is true for send location.

07:53.630 --> 07:57.660
I can send off my location is going to send it to the server.

07:57.770 --> 08:02.150
It's going to send it to all the clients and right here I can click the my current location link and

08:02.150 --> 08:05.840
the location is going to show up inside of Google Maps.

08:05.860 --> 08:11.130
We've maintained all of the old functionality well adding a nice set of styles.

08:11.330 --> 08:16.130
Now for the second half of this video I want to make some user experience improvements to the form down

08:16.130 --> 08:21.590
below what improvement we're going to make as wiping the text value once a message was successfully

08:21.590 --> 08:22.340
sent.

08:22.340 --> 08:26.570
We're also going to do something similar with send location as you might have noticed it can take up

08:26.570 --> 08:31.950
to a second or two for the send location geo location called to actually complete.

08:32.030 --> 08:35.990
We're going to set this button to be disabled so someone doesn't span it.

08:35.990 --> 08:37.380
Wondering what's happened.

08:37.400 --> 08:42.620
We're also going to update the text to say sending location so someone knows that something is happening

08:42.860 --> 08:43.880
in the background.

08:43.910 --> 08:49.970
Now in order to get those things done all we need to do is modify a few lines over inside of index dot.

08:49.990 --> 08:52.860
J.S. near the bottom of the file we have our two.

08:52.880 --> 08:57.720
Jay queery event listeners both of these are going to get changed.

08:57.740 --> 09:02.470
Now the first thing we're going to change is going to be the form submit listener.

09:02.540 --> 09:08.150
Right here we fetch the value from the field and that's what we pass along what we want to do down below

09:08.180 --> 09:13.760
inside of the acknowledgement callback is clear the value once the request has been received by the

09:13.760 --> 09:15.860
server there's no reason to keep it around.

09:15.860 --> 09:20.590
So what we can do is add the same J Aquarius selector which will break out in just a moment.

09:21.430 --> 09:26.920
Targeting the field worthy name attribute equals message and we're going to go ahead and clear its value

09:26.920 --> 09:28.970
by calling Val once again.

09:29.020 --> 09:34.240
But instead of getting a value by providing no arguments like we do here we're going to set the value

09:34.240 --> 09:38.690
to an empty string by passing in an empty string as the first argument.

09:38.740 --> 09:43.660
You could set the value to anything you like but in this case we just want to clear it.

09:43.660 --> 09:46.550
So we're going to use the following method call.

09:46.570 --> 09:49.570
Now we have the same selector twice to speed things up.

09:49.600 --> 09:57.370
We're going to make a variable we'll call that variable message text box and then we can go ahead and

09:57.370 --> 10:02.070
set it equal to the selector we just created down below.

10:02.160 --> 10:06.840
And now we can refer to message text box any anywhere we need access to that input.

10:06.870 --> 10:16.930
Right here we can reference it message text box and down below message text box.

10:16.930 --> 10:17.670
Awesome.

10:18.010 --> 10:21.620
Now the listener for create message which is over inside of server.

10:21.680 --> 10:26.070
J.S. sits right here and we do indeed call the call back with a string.

10:26.080 --> 10:30.510
For now we're going to just remove that bogus value passing zero arguments.

10:30.520 --> 10:34.630
This means that the acknowledgement function will still get called over here but we don't actually need

10:34.630 --> 10:35.160
any data.

10:35.170 --> 10:38.130
We just need to know when the server responded.

10:38.230 --> 10:43.330
Now that we have this in place we can go ahead and refresh things over inside of local host 3000 type

10:43.330 --> 10:45.040
a message.

10:45.100 --> 10:48.250
Here is a message and hit the enter key and what do we get.

10:48.250 --> 10:51.090
We get the value cleared and was indeed sent.

10:51.190 --> 10:55.900
The same thing is going to hold true if I type in a message and click the send button.

10:55.900 --> 11:00.880
Now one thing we're going to do real quick is update the input tag for this text box.

11:00.880 --> 11:06.340
If I refresh the page we're currently not brought right into the message feel that would be really nice

11:06.430 --> 11:11.440
to do that would also be really nice to turn off auto complete as you can see auto complete isn't really

11:11.440 --> 11:12.420
a useful feature.

11:12.460 --> 11:15.970
It's hidden down below and the values inside of it are usually trash.

11:15.970 --> 11:21.700
So what we're going to do over inside of Adam is add two attributes to customize the input.

11:21.700 --> 11:27.780
The first one is going to be auto focus which doesn't require a value.

11:27.870 --> 11:33.790
Autofocus is going to auto focus on this input when the template gets rendered and the second one we're

11:33.790 --> 11:39.300
going to add is auto complete and we're going to set that equal to the string off.

11:39.430 --> 11:45.400
With this in place we can save index dot HD and now head back over to Chrome refresh the page and test

11:45.460 --> 11:46.660
things out.

11:46.660 --> 11:47.950
I'm going to type in test right here.

11:47.950 --> 11:49.570
I have no auto complete which is good.

11:49.570 --> 11:54.510
We turned that off and if I clicked the send button I am indeed still sending the message.

11:54.610 --> 11:57.730
I was also brought right into the text box when I reloaded the page.

11:57.730 --> 12:02.650
I didn't need to do anything in order to start typing perfect.

12:02.740 --> 12:07.870
The next thing we're going to do is customize that send location by using a bit more Jay query.

12:07.870 --> 12:11.050
Now we're new to Jay Aquarians isn't really a jay queery course.

12:11.140 --> 12:15.610
You can feel free to try to treat some of these as challenges though I won't be giving you many Jay

12:15.610 --> 12:17.330
query related challenges.

12:17.410 --> 12:21.570
We're going to stick to the challenges that require you to do some node code.

12:21.580 --> 12:26.430
The goal here is to change the button text and disable it while the process is occurring.

12:26.590 --> 12:31.930
When the process is complete meaning that the location was either sent or not sent we can return them

12:31.930 --> 12:33.620
back into its normal state.

12:33.820 --> 12:36.040
But well the geolocation call is happening.

12:36.040 --> 12:39.140
We don't want someone spamming away to get that done.

12:39.140 --> 12:45.080
We're gonna make some tweaks to the final on listener we have inside of index dot J s just below our

12:45.100 --> 12:48.700
on submit listener We have our on click listener here.

12:48.700 --> 12:54.130
We're going to need to make some changes to the button the location button variable we have defined

12:54.280 --> 12:55.520
right here.

12:55.540 --> 13:00.320
We're going to set an attribute that's going to disable the button to get that done.

13:00.340 --> 13:08.480
We will reference the selector up above location button and we're going to call Jay Querrey method.

13:08.490 --> 13:12.600
Now we're only going to disable it after we've confirmed that even have support for it.

13:12.660 --> 13:17.570
If they don't have support for the feature there's no reason to go ahead and disable it right here location

13:17.620 --> 13:18.390
button.

13:18.770 --> 13:21.880
TR is going to let us set an attribute.

13:21.960 --> 13:28.890
We're going to set the disabled attribute equal to the value disabled.

13:28.910 --> 13:32.390
Now this disabled needs to be in quotes as well just like this.

13:32.480 --> 13:35.870
Now that we have disabled the button we could actually test this out.

13:35.930 --> 13:39.250
We never undecidable it so it's going to be broken after clicking at once.

13:39.320 --> 13:42.990
But we can confirm that this line works over in the browser.

13:42.990 --> 13:47.540
I'm going to give things a refresh click send location and you can see right away that the button does

13:47.540 --> 13:48.500
get disabled.

13:48.500 --> 13:53.030
Now it is going to send off location once but if I try to click it again the buttons disabled and it's

13:53.030 --> 13:56.060
never going to refire the click event.

13:56.060 --> 13:57.830
The goal here is to only disable it.

13:57.890 --> 14:01.550
Well the process is actually occurring once it's sent like it is here.

14:01.640 --> 14:07.670
We want to re-enable it so someone can send an updated location to get that done over inside of Adam.

14:07.670 --> 14:13.790
We're going to add a line of Jay queery into both the success handler and the error handler.

14:13.970 --> 14:20.870
If things go well we're going to reference location button and we're going to remove the disabled attribute

14:21.050 --> 14:24.290
by using remove a TTR.

14:24.290 --> 14:27.160
And this takes just one argument in the name of the attribute.

14:27.260 --> 14:30.560
In this case we have that it's a string disabled.

14:30.560 --> 14:35.990
This is going to remove the disabled attribute we defined above re-enabling the button and we can do

14:35.990 --> 14:40.410
the exact same thing literally copying and pasting the line down below.

14:40.580 --> 14:46.680
If for some reason we're not able to fetch that location maybe the user denied the request for geo location.

14:46.730 --> 14:50.780
We still want to disable that button so they can try again.

14:50.780 --> 14:55.610
Now that we have this set up we can test out that code by refreshing the browser and trying to send

14:55.610 --> 14:57.020
off our location.

14:57.020 --> 15:00.440
We should see the buttons disabled for a little bit and then it gets re-enabled.

15:00.440 --> 15:00.930
There we go.

15:00.950 --> 15:02.080
It's disabled.

15:02.180 --> 15:04.630
It's about one to three seconds.

15:04.640 --> 15:05.510
And there we go.

15:05.510 --> 15:07.070
The location has been processed.

15:07.070 --> 15:09.890
We can click it to prove that it is working as expected.

15:10.040 --> 15:15.470
And the button was re-enabled which means we can go ahead and click it at a later time sending our location

15:15.650 --> 15:16.810
once again.

15:17.150 --> 15:19.870
Now the last thing we're going to do is update the button text.

15:19.940 --> 15:24.380
Well the process is occurring to get that done over inside of Adam.

15:24.380 --> 15:28.290
We're going to use that text method that we've used in the past right here.

15:28.340 --> 15:38.120
We're going to set the text equal to my calling text sending location dot dot dot.

15:38.140 --> 15:41.900
Now the real button text is send a location with a capital L..

15:41.950 --> 15:45.450
I'm going to go ahead and lowercase that to keep things uniform.

15:45.520 --> 15:46.150
Awesome.

15:46.480 --> 15:51.130
Now that we have this set up we are updating the text while the process occurs.

15:51.130 --> 15:56.470
The only thing left to do is tweak it back to its original value down below by setting text equal to

15:56.470 --> 16:03.190
the string send location here and we're going to do the exact same thing down below calling text passing

16:03.190 --> 16:05.930
in the string send location.

16:06.250 --> 16:07.120
Excellent.

16:07.130 --> 16:09.820
Now we can go ahead and test that this is working as expected.

16:09.820 --> 16:14.370
Both of these lines are identical regardless of whether it succeeds or fails.

16:14.380 --> 16:17.650
We're going to do the same thing over inside of chrome.

16:17.660 --> 16:20.020
Going to give my page a refresh one more time.

16:20.050 --> 16:24.760
We're going to click that send location button and you can see the button is disabled and the text was

16:24.760 --> 16:29.950
changed sending location shows up and as soon as the process is complete and the location was actually

16:29.950 --> 16:33.670
sent the button returns to its default state.

16:33.670 --> 16:38.920
With this in place we now have a much nicer user experience than we had previously had only do we have

16:38.920 --> 16:39.880
a nice set of styles.

16:39.880 --> 16:44.770
We also have a better UI for our form and the send location button.

16:45.070 --> 16:47.170
That is where we are going to stop for this one.

16:47.170 --> 16:53.260
Let's go ahead and make a quick commit by shutting down the server running get status running get add

16:53.260 --> 16:55.810
to add all of those files.

16:55.950 --> 17:03.560
And finally we're going to go ahead and run get commit with the flag providing a message and see SS

17:03.740 --> 17:06.200
for chat page.

17:06.380 --> 17:10.480
We can go ahead and push this up to get how then I'm going to avoid deploying for Heroku right now although

17:10.490 --> 17:14.500
you are welcome to deploy and test your application live.

17:14.560 --> 17:15.740
And that is it for this one.

17:15.740 --> 17:17.200
I will see you next time.
