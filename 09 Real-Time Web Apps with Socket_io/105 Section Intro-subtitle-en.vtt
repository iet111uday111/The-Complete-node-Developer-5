Welcome to Section 9 a real time web apps with socket I O.

00:05.890 --> 00:10.480
In this section you're going to learn about socket IO and web sockets which enable two way communication

00:10.480 --> 00:12.820
between the server and the client.

00:12.820 --> 00:16.450
This means that we're not only going to be setting up a node server We're also going to be setting up

00:16.450 --> 00:22.000
a client this client could be a web app it could be an iPhone app or an Android app for this course.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.570
The client will be a web application.

00:24.580 --> 00:28.900
This means that we're going to be connecting the two allowing data to flow seamlessly from either the

00:28.900 --> 00:32.070
browser to the server or from the server to the browser.

00:32.080 --> 00:36.730
Now with our to do app data can only flow in one direction the client had to initialize the request

00:36.970 --> 00:38.040
with socket I O.

00:38.170 --> 00:41.220
We're going to be able to send data back and forth instantly.

00:41.230 --> 00:46.960
This means that for real time apps like an email app a food ordering app or a chat app the server doesn't

00:46.960 --> 00:52.450
need to wait for the client to request information the server can say hey I just got something you probably

00:52.450 --> 00:53.490
want to show the user.

00:53.500 --> 00:54.640
So here it is.

00:54.730 --> 00:58.630
This is going to open up a world of possibilities and we're going to get started by figuring out how

00:58.630 --> 01:01.320
to integrate SOC and I go into a node app.

01:01.390 --> 01:03.090
That's exactly what we're going to get started.

01:03.100 --> 01:04.380
So let's dive in.
