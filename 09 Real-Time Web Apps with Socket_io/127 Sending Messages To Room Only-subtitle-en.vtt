WEBVTT

00:00.300 --> 00:05.700
In the last video we wired up that people list making sure that as new users come and go the list gets

00:05.730 --> 00:06.520
updated.

00:06.600 --> 00:11.700
In this video we're going to make sure that our text and location messages only get sent to users in

00:11.700 --> 00:12.650
the same room.

00:12.660 --> 00:14.870
Currently it gets sent to everybody.

00:14.940 --> 00:17.710
We can prove that by opening up a new connection.

00:17.790 --> 00:23.460
I'm going to use my name and we're going to join a different room from EHLO TR The Office fans works

00:23.760 --> 00:27.780
when I join the room you can see that the people lists are indeed correct.

00:27.780 --> 00:32.310
A user in one room does not update the people list for a user in another room.

00:32.310 --> 00:36.300
The difference though is that the text messages do not follow those rules.

00:36.330 --> 00:39.410
Neither do the location based messages.

00:39.420 --> 00:42.960
Here we have a text message any location message as well.

00:42.960 --> 00:48.930
If I go over to the chat app for the other room we get both of those and this is a problem.

00:48.990 --> 00:50.930
We also have the name problem.

00:50.940 --> 00:56.180
Currently user displays for the text message and admin displays for the location message.

00:56.280 --> 01:01.770
We want to make sure to use the actual user's name whether it's Jan in this case or whether it's Andrew

01:02.400 --> 01:05.860
in order to get that done we are going to need to make some changes to both server.

01:05.870 --> 01:12.510
J.S. Right here we have our event listeners for create message and create location message and we're

01:12.510 --> 01:15.890
also going to be making some updates over inside of chat.

01:15.990 --> 01:18.300
Yes and this is actually where we're going to start.

01:18.300 --> 01:24.450
Currently the name user the incorrect name we saw over inside of the browser that comes from right here.

01:24.540 --> 01:28.410
The client originally sent the name of this is no longer going to be the case.

01:28.410 --> 01:30.630
The name is stored by the server.

01:30.630 --> 01:34.650
So we're going to remove this as a required property from create message.

01:34.650 --> 01:37.550
We're just going to be sending the text across.

01:37.830 --> 01:41.660
Now with this in place we can modify the event listener over inside of server.

01:41.670 --> 01:48.520
J.S. inside of server ask create message takes those two properties and it stuffs them right here into

01:48.520 --> 01:52.400
to generate message instead we're going to find the user using.

01:52.420 --> 01:54.030
Users not get user.

01:54.090 --> 01:56.960
And we're going to do something with it right here.

01:57.000 --> 02:01.860
We can go ahead and delete our council dialog statement for create message and we're going to make a

02:01.860 --> 02:07.620
variable user setting an equal to users dot get user.

02:07.650 --> 02:14.700
This is the method we created over here get user which takes the idea we can pass in the ID socket dot

02:14.730 --> 02:18.510
ID and now we can do something with that user.

02:18.510 --> 02:23.850
We only want to do something if a user actually exists which means that we're going to check if the

02:23.850 --> 02:26.300
user exists using this statement.

02:26.370 --> 02:32.400
And we're also going to make sure that the text that got passed along was a real string using after

02:32.400 --> 02:39.720
and is real string and will be passing in message dot text.

02:39.720 --> 02:44.940
This means if someone tries to send across an empty message or just a bunch of spaces it's not going

02:44.940 --> 02:47.200
to get sent to everybody else.

02:47.280 --> 02:52.290
Now inside of here all we're going to do is actually emit the message we know it's valid so we do want

02:52.290 --> 02:53.280
to emit something.

02:53.280 --> 02:57.230
We're going to take this line cut it out and paste it right here.

02:57.270 --> 03:03.930
Now currently this line it emits to everybody not just the room the user is connected to.

03:03.930 --> 03:08.880
And we also use message from we really want to use the name property on user.

03:08.880 --> 03:13.620
Your challenge right now is going to be to make those two changes and this event just to the room the

03:13.620 --> 03:20.220
user is connected to and make sure to provide their name right here as opposed to message dot from when

03:20.220 --> 03:25.380
you're done you can refresh your browser tabs send some text messages around and you should see the

03:25.380 --> 03:30.600
user's name as opposed to what you currently see which is the static text user.

03:30.660 --> 03:31.530
Knock that out.

03:31.530 --> 03:37.130
Pause the video and when you're done click play.

03:37.140 --> 03:37.710
All right.

03:37.710 --> 03:41.190
Getting this done requires some modifications to this line.

03:41.190 --> 03:48.000
First up we want to get to just a specific room and we know we can tack on a to call right here to get

03:48.000 --> 03:48.760
that done.

03:48.810 --> 03:54.990
Passing in the room name we have access to that on the user object user dot road.

03:55.200 --> 04:00.690
Now that we're admitting to just the individual room we also do want to change the name we use instead

04:00.690 --> 04:02.180
of message from.

04:02.310 --> 04:06.600
We're going to access the name on the user object user name and there we go.

04:06.600 --> 04:10.690
Now we have a much better system for sending those text messages.

04:10.710 --> 04:16.590
I'm going to refresh my first tab and my second tab and we're going to send some text messages around.

04:16.680 --> 04:18.320
I'm going to send the number one right here.

04:18.330 --> 04:23.370
And we do get Andrew and we do see the number one and over inside of our other tab the message is nowhere

04:23.370 --> 04:27.980
to be found because we're just admitting it to users in the office fans.

04:28.040 --> 04:30.510
But I try to send a message from this first tab.

04:30.510 --> 04:32.710
We're going to see it here with the name Jan..

04:32.880 --> 04:34.650
And the second tab also looks good.

04:34.650 --> 04:37.580
We're not seeing that message from Jan..

04:37.620 --> 04:40.350
Now I can go ahead and join a room again.

04:40.350 --> 04:41.520
I'm going to use the name Mike.

04:41.550 --> 04:45.100
And we're going to join the office fans one more time.

04:45.150 --> 04:51.180
When I joined the room I do see and you and Mike both connected and if I send a message like should

04:51.180 --> 04:51.720
work.

04:51.840 --> 04:52.770
I see it here.

04:52.860 --> 04:58.030
And I also see it in the tab of the other user connected to the office fans.

04:58.080 --> 05:02.340
And once again it's not visible to someone else connected to a different room.

05:02.340 --> 05:06.150
That is all we need to do to get our messages sending correctly.

05:06.180 --> 05:11.650
And the last thing to do is to wire that up for create location message.

05:11.690 --> 05:16.620
Now as we just saw we were also able to fix the validation issue if I tried to hit enter right now.

05:16.620 --> 05:17.520
Nothing happens.

05:17.520 --> 05:19.190
I don't get moved out of the box.

05:19.200 --> 05:22.390
The focus doesn't change and no message is sent.

05:22.410 --> 05:27.280
Right now I am smashing the enter key and nothing's happening which is great.

05:27.420 --> 05:32.840
Over inside of Adam your challenge is going to be to fix create location message.

05:32.880 --> 05:35.690
You're going to want to find the user just like we do above.

05:35.850 --> 05:43.110
If there is a user you're going to want to admit this to just people in the same room instead of providing

05:43.110 --> 05:44.290
admin as the name.

05:44.310 --> 05:47.940
You're also going to want to use the user's real name.

05:47.940 --> 05:52.110
Once you're done you can go ahead and test this out by refreshing those tabs and trying to send the

05:52.110 --> 05:53.140
location around.

05:53.280 --> 05:58.470
Make sure it still gets sent to users in the same room and make sure it does not get sent to users in

05:58.530 --> 05:59.500
other rooms.

05:59.520 --> 06:00.310
Pause the video.

06:00.330 --> 06:06.760
Knock that out test it and when you're done go ahead and click play to do this one.

06:06.760 --> 06:12.360
I am going to start by fetching the user since we are going to need to use the information on that object.

06:12.460 --> 06:14.690
We're going to make a variable user calling.

06:14.700 --> 06:20.690
Users don't get user and we're going to pass in that socket ID socket ID.

06:20.770 --> 06:23.430
This is identical to the line that we used above.

06:23.710 --> 06:26.780
Now we only want to emit a message if we do find a users.

06:26.800 --> 06:29.590
I'm going to check if the user object exists.

06:29.590 --> 06:36.390
If it does we can take this line cut it out and copy it right here if it does exist we are going to

06:36.400 --> 06:39.230
emit new location message.

06:39.240 --> 06:44.730
Now we do still need to emit it to just a specific room by adding on a call to two and passing in the

06:44.730 --> 06:48.120
room name user room stores that information.

06:48.150 --> 06:54.110
And last but not least we do want to update the name instead of sending the static admin name.

06:54.120 --> 06:57.930
We're going to use the user's real name user dot name.

06:58.080 --> 07:04.020
With this in place create location message is now wired up to be private and to send across the correct

07:04.170 --> 07:06.270
information over inside of chrome.

07:06.300 --> 07:11.010
I'm going to go through my tabs one at a time giving them a refresh and on the third tab I am going

07:11.010 --> 07:12.610
to be sending the location.

07:12.690 --> 07:15.490
This is going to take just a couple of seconds to actually fetch it.

07:15.570 --> 07:17.730
And I see it right here with the name showing up.

07:17.730 --> 07:18.350
Correct.

07:18.360 --> 07:23.220
We have Mike and we have a link to view the location inside of Google Maps.

07:23.220 --> 07:28.350
Now if I go to the second tab the user who is also connected to the office fans I see the exact same

07:28.350 --> 07:33.540
location message and then I go to the first one you can see that John does not have access to that message

07:33.570 --> 07:35.140
because she's in a different room.

07:35.190 --> 07:37.830
She can only share her location with anybody in her room.

07:37.890 --> 07:39.260
That happens to be nobody.

07:39.300 --> 07:45.720
This message is not going to show up anywhere because no one else is connected to EHLO t r with that

07:45.720 --> 07:47.280
in place we are now done.

07:47.400 --> 07:49.410
Our messages are private.

07:49.440 --> 07:52.930
They're only going to be visible to folks in the same room.

07:52.980 --> 07:55.980
Let's go ahead and wrap this one up by committing our changes.

07:55.980 --> 07:58.620
I'm going to shut down the no man server.

07:58.860 --> 08:03.990
Use clear and we can run get status to see what kind of changes we have here we just have two files

08:04.110 --> 08:10.140
they're modified which means we can use to get commit with the flag whether it's separate or the same.

08:10.140 --> 08:19.310
They have identical feature sets and then we provide our message string send messages to only people

08:19.820 --> 08:22.830
in same room.

08:22.880 --> 08:23.590
Awesome.

08:23.840 --> 08:28.800
With this in place we can go ahead and use get push to push this up to get hard.

08:28.910 --> 08:35.330
And I'm also going to go ahead and deployed to Heroku using get push Heroku master once it's deployed

08:35.330 --> 08:40.070
on Heroku we can take just a quick moment to make sure all of those features we just added are still

08:40.070 --> 08:41.600
working as expected.

08:41.600 --> 08:46.910
I expect they will still work but it's definitely worth checking out because the environments are little

08:46.910 --> 08:49.360
different and there's always a chance something can go wrong.

08:49.610 --> 08:54.250
Now something does go wrong as a reminder you can always use Heroku lags.

08:54.260 --> 08:56.770
This is going to show you the logs on the server.

08:56.810 --> 09:02.150
It's usually kind of cryptic but when an error occurs you're going to see a really big block.

09:02.210 --> 09:08.650
It's usually pretty easy to spot and it usually contains useful information as to what went wrong.

09:08.660 --> 09:14.750
It looks like our app deployed successfully so I can use Heroku open to open it up inside of my browser.

09:14.750 --> 09:20.180
And once it's open we can actually visit some chat rooms I'm going to close down my local host tab and

09:20.180 --> 09:29.070
I'm going to join as Andrew the room Philadelphia once I'm in the room I am going to send a message

09:29.250 --> 09:32.120
and then I'm going to add a second user to the room.

09:32.130 --> 09:35.620
Local host 3000 excuse me not local host.

09:35.730 --> 09:39.010
We want to visit this Web site our Heroku app.

09:39.420 --> 09:45.240
I'm going to visit that will join the room as victim and we can join the exact same room Philadelphia

09:45.480 --> 09:46.170
when I join.

09:46.180 --> 09:49.800
I see the people list updates for both and sending messages.

09:49.800 --> 09:51.270
Does it still work.

09:51.270 --> 09:54.360
Messages from tab to do appear in Tab 1.

09:54.360 --> 09:56.190
This is great.

09:56.190 --> 10:02.160
All this is possible because we wired up server J ass keeping track of users over time.

10:02.160 --> 10:07.380
When they first join we add them to the list when they send messages we make sure to use their information

10:07.410 --> 10:10.300
and when they leave we remove them from the list.

10:10.440 --> 10:15.420
This ensures that the people list is always up to date and that messages are only getting sent to others

10:15.450 --> 10:16.610
in the same room.

10:16.740 --> 10:17.730
That's it for this one.

10:17.730 --> 10:19.480
I will see you next time.
