Now that we have our people list in place and our messages are only getting sent to the users in the

00:05.160 --> 00:07.290
same chat room we are done.

00:07.410 --> 00:12.420
But that doesn't mean you have to stop developing the chat app students like to add on new features

00:12.420 --> 00:17.020
and they always post them in the Q&amp;A and it's really cool to see what people build.

00:17.130 --> 00:20.290
I like to give you a few ideas as to what you can build right now.

00:20.370 --> 00:24.450
You might get stuck with adding these features it might be a real pain in the butt and it might take

00:24.450 --> 00:30.610
forever but I promise you're going to learn so much along the way and doing something on your own.

00:30.630 --> 00:35.250
They have all the skills to do these features so let's just go down the list really quick one awesome

00:35.250 --> 00:38.820
idea would be to make chat rooms case insensitive.

00:38.820 --> 00:45.450
Currently if I go to EHLO TR with a lowercase are not actually in the same chat room as my friend who's

00:45.510 --> 00:51.300
an EHLO TR uppercase r it would be nice if regardless of case we were all in the same room.

00:51.660 --> 00:54.310
Next up I'd like to make user names unique.

00:54.310 --> 01:00.700
Currently I can copy the R L and paste in a new tab and now I have two people with the name of jewels.

01:00.750 --> 01:06.870
It would be cool to reject new users who also have the same name as an existing user.

01:06.870 --> 01:11.760
Next up one idea that I was thinking about adding that would be pretty cool is to add a list of the

01:11.760 --> 01:14.590
currently active chat rooms down below.

01:14.730 --> 01:17.060
This could be a select dropdown.

01:17.100 --> 01:18.180
It's going to repopulate.

01:18.180 --> 01:20.770
Kind of like the People's list repopulate.

01:20.790 --> 01:24.830
This is by far the hardest feature but I think it would be really cool.

01:24.840 --> 01:30.210
That means I would see a drop down in between the join and the input box and it would have the two currently

01:30.210 --> 01:31.170
active rooms.

01:31.260 --> 01:36.990
Hello TR and EHLO TR with an uppercase are although hopefully if you implement that first feature we

01:36.990 --> 01:38.690
would only see one room.

01:38.880 --> 01:43.380
Then instead of typing in a room name I could just pick one from the dropdown type in a name and join

01:43.470 --> 01:44.150
that way.

01:44.340 --> 01:49.560
These are just a few ideas of how you can continue on with a chat app if you do end up adding any of

01:49.560 --> 01:49.890
these.

01:49.890 --> 01:52.210
I would love to see what you built.

01:52.260 --> 01:58.620
Please post it in the Q&amp;A with a link to the Heroku application or any other link that lets me play

01:58.620 --> 02:00.730
around with it and that's it for now.

02:00.780 --> 02:02.260
I will see you soon
