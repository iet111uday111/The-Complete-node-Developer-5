WEBVTT

00:01.250 --> 00:06.940
As I mentioned in the end of the last video starting from here on out the goal is to add a joined page

00:06.950 --> 00:12.690
like the one you see here where you provide a name and you provide the room name you want to join.

00:12.710 --> 00:17.660
You'll then be able to join a given room talk to anybody else in that room and you won't be able to

00:17.660 --> 00:21.050
communicate with other people in other rooms.

00:21.050 --> 00:25.220
This means that when you click this form you're going to click join and we're going to have some custom

00:25.220 --> 00:30.060
information passed into the you R-AL into the chat application as we know it.

00:30.080 --> 00:32.170
The one that looks like this.

00:32.300 --> 00:37.610
Now in order to get that done the first thing we're going to do is tweak the current age template file

00:37.820 --> 00:39.310
right now indexed.

00:39.410 --> 00:41.260
Tim L. is going to load first.

00:41.330 --> 00:45.210
We actually don't want that to be the case when we go to local 3000.

00:45.290 --> 00:47.230
We want to show our new joined page.

00:47.300 --> 00:54.440
So what I'm going to do instead is move this by renaming it we're going to rename index ADOT h DML to

00:54.440 --> 01:01.590
chat dot h DML and I'm going to do the exact same thing with index dot J.S. renaming it to chat.

01:01.640 --> 01:02.260
J.S..

01:02.570 --> 01:05.090
And last but not least I'm going to update the reference.

01:05.090 --> 01:09.700
Down below where we load an index datcha Yes Instead we'll load and chat.

01:09.860 --> 01:10.670
Yes.

01:10.730 --> 01:15.380
Now that we have this in place we no longer have an HTL page that's going to load when you visit the

01:15.380 --> 01:15.960
site.

01:16.050 --> 01:21.130
If I try to go to localhost 3000 we're going to get an error saying we cannot get that route.

01:21.170 --> 01:24.230
Nothing's coming back from the server to fix this.

01:24.230 --> 01:28.350
We're going to create our brand new page as index dot h DML.

01:28.370 --> 01:32.420
This is going to be the one that loads when a user visits the app.

01:32.750 --> 01:37.820
Now we'll start off with the very basic template specifying things we've done before like a dock type

01:38.110 --> 01:45.650
setting equal to H.T. in L5 and then we're going to go ahead and at our age Tamal tag inside of here

01:45.680 --> 01:53.450
we can then add our head and body tags and I had my head tag first then I can go ahead and add my body

01:53.450 --> 02:01.340
tag and we'll kick things off by adding a few tags into the head like Mehta So we can set our char set

02:02.380 --> 02:03.080
right here.

02:03.920 --> 02:11.950
Charsadda is going to equal UTF 8 and we're also going to see a few other properties.

02:11.990 --> 02:13.660
I'm going to set a title tag.

02:13.760 --> 02:17.570
This is going to show up inside of the tab as the tabs title.

02:17.690 --> 02:24.950
We can set ours to join then we can add a space a vertical line by using shift backslash and the name

02:24.950 --> 02:27.310
of our app something like chat app.

02:27.320 --> 02:32.300
This will show up in the tab a title and then we can go ahead and link in our stylesheet just like we

02:32.300 --> 02:33.730
did for chat.

02:33.850 --> 02:35.460
HTL right here.

02:35.480 --> 02:37.250
I'm going to get that style sheet reference.

02:37.250 --> 02:44.000
Copy it into the head and I'm going to add that title tag to chat h out right here in Schacht out aged

02:44.010 --> 02:49.130
TNL know we can specify a title just like we did over inside of index dot h DML.

02:49.160 --> 02:55.080
We can give this one a page of chat with a bar surrounded by spaces.

02:55.220 --> 02:59.310
And we're also going to give it the same app name chat app.

02:59.360 --> 03:00.350
Awesome.

03:00.590 --> 03:04.790
Now that we have this in place there is one more thing I want to do before we start updating the body.

03:04.790 --> 03:06.670
This is set a viewport.

03:06.660 --> 03:11.840
Tag viewport tags let you specify certain things about how your site should be rendered.

03:11.990 --> 03:17.720
The viewport tag I'm about to add is going to make our website display much better armed mobile instead

03:17.720 --> 03:19.240
of being really zoomed out.

03:19.250 --> 03:24.020
It's going to fit to the width of your phone tablet or any other device.

03:24.020 --> 03:27.310
We're going to copy this tag from index that TNL to chat.

03:27.340 --> 03:27.650
H.

03:27.650 --> 03:28.780
Female when we're done.

03:28.820 --> 03:33.650
But for now we'll kick things off by adding a metal tag this time around instead of specifying char

03:33.650 --> 03:35.330
set like we've done in the past.

03:35.360 --> 03:38.210
We're going to give it a name equal to view part.

03:38.330 --> 03:43.730
And now we can go ahead and add a few options about what we want to do to that viewport.

03:43.730 --> 03:45.860
All this is going to happen inside of content.

03:45.890 --> 03:51.890
This is going to be a comma separated list of key value pairs one for example is with we're going to

03:51.890 --> 03:55.170
set that equal to device hyphen with.

03:55.280 --> 04:01.610
And this tells your browser to use the devices with as the web pages with then we can add a comma space

04:01.610 --> 04:04.060
and specify our next key value pair.

04:04.280 --> 04:08.140
I'm going to use initials scale.

04:08.210 --> 04:10.010
We're going to set that equal to 1.

04:10.010 --> 04:13.680
This is going to scale the website appropriately so it doesn't look all zoomed out.

04:13.790 --> 04:18.250
And finally user high and scalable will set that equal to.

04:18.260 --> 04:23.540
No we have styles in place to make the text bigger and to make sure that user can always see everything.

04:23.540 --> 04:27.080
So there's no reason to give users the ability to scale.

04:27.080 --> 04:31.500
Now as mentioned we're going to take this matter a tag copy it to the clipboard and add it for chapter

04:31.580 --> 04:33.640
HVM Tamal as well.

04:33.650 --> 04:34.250
Awesome.

04:34.450 --> 04:41.790
And now that we have our head tags set up for index HGL we can move on to the body we're going to be

04:41.790 --> 04:47.880
using a similar set of classes designed to work with this page to get things off on the body.

04:47.880 --> 04:53.180
We're going to add a class of centered hyphen form.

04:53.180 --> 04:59.030
This is going to center that form in the screen and give the entire website that blue background with

04:59.030 --> 05:00.040
the gradient.

05:00.050 --> 05:02.720
Next up we can go ahead and provide the little box.

05:02.720 --> 05:06.380
This is going to be the centered white box that has our form in it.

05:06.380 --> 05:13.440
That's going to be via a div and we're going to give this div a class we're going to set that class

05:13.470 --> 05:18.180
equal to inside of quotes centered high and form.

05:18.190 --> 05:20.490
Underscore underscore form.

05:20.650 --> 05:21.480
Awesome.

05:21.490 --> 05:26.740
Now that we have these two classes in place we are ready to move on actually adding some of the fields

05:26.740 --> 05:29.130
that are going to go in that white box starting with that title.

05:29.140 --> 05:30.710
Chat to do this.

05:30.760 --> 05:35.200
We're going to create a few divs they're all going to look identical so we'll make them once and duplicate

05:35.260 --> 05:35.760
them.

05:35.890 --> 05:41.560
And we're going to add a class equal to form high thin field.

05:41.560 --> 05:45.460
Now we're going to use this four times once for the title once for the name.

05:45.490 --> 05:51.160
Once for the room name and once for the button in order to get that done what we're going to do is simply

05:51.160 --> 05:54.700
copy the line and paste it four times right here.

05:54.700 --> 06:00.010
Now all of this needs to go inside of a form tag the whole goal of this page is to take that data and

06:00.010 --> 06:05.050
submit it redirecting the user to the chat page where we can then bring them into a specific chat room

06:05.260 --> 06:06.950
using the name they provided.

06:06.970 --> 06:12.910
That means we want to wrap these form fields inside of a form tag by opening here and closing it down

06:12.940 --> 06:13.670
below.

06:15.800 --> 06:21.710
Now previously we saw the default behavior for a form tag is to reload the current page posting the

06:21.710 --> 06:23.580
data as a query string.

06:23.600 --> 06:29.120
Well we're going to do instead is specify an action attribute which lets us customize which page to

06:29.120 --> 06:30.020
go to.

06:30.080 --> 06:32.990
In this case we're going to go to a forward slash chat.

06:33.020 --> 06:37.100
H TNL the page that we set up just now.

06:37.100 --> 06:40.490
This means that when someone's done filling out the form field they're going to get redirected to the

06:40.490 --> 06:44.630
chat page and the data down below will get passed along to.

06:44.720 --> 06:49.610
Now the title div is easy or we're going to do is at an H three with whatever title you want.

06:49.700 --> 06:52.100
You could say chat or join the chat.

06:52.520 --> 06:57.770
That looks pretty good then I can go ahead and close my H-3 and move on to the next to form field which

06:57.770 --> 06:59.770
is going to be the display name.

06:59.870 --> 07:04.280
I am going to use a label a label is going to describe a field.

07:04.430 --> 07:10.310
This one will be display name so will open and close the label tag like this and next up we can add

07:10.310 --> 07:12.080
an input right here.

07:12.140 --> 07:16.690
We're going to add an input just like we did for the input on our message form.

07:16.760 --> 07:19.370
We're going to specify type equal to text.

07:19.400 --> 07:25.790
We want the user to be able to enter some text and we're also going to give it a name equal to name.

07:25.790 --> 07:27.260
We are going to use auto focus.

07:27.260 --> 07:32.600
Once again this is going to make sure that when a user first visits the app their cursor is placed inside

07:32.600 --> 07:34.490
of the name field.

07:34.490 --> 07:39.270
Next up is the field for the room name which is going to look pretty similar to the one above.

07:39.410 --> 07:45.740
We are going to start with a label once again this label is going to be a string something like room

07:47.000 --> 07:49.790
name and we're also going to add an input right here.

07:49.790 --> 07:58.930
So the user can specify the room name type equals text and the name will equal a room.

07:58.970 --> 08:05.900
There is no need for autofocus on this one since we already have an auto focused input up above.

08:05.940 --> 08:10.520
Now that we have this in place we can go ahead and the final form field which is going to be the submit

08:10.520 --> 08:17.880
button for our form by simply creating a button just like this and giving it a text value.

08:17.880 --> 08:22.210
We can have ours set to join with this in place our index.

08:22.230 --> 08:24.280
Each time a file is actually done.

08:24.390 --> 08:26.190
We can load it over inside of the browser.

08:26.250 --> 08:28.630
Our server had automatically restarted.

08:28.650 --> 08:32.380
So a quick refresh should show our page join a chat app.

08:32.610 --> 08:40.650
The goal is to set this up to take a name like Andrew and a room name like Noad course students you

08:40.650 --> 08:44.580
click join and it joins you into this room with this name.

08:44.580 --> 08:48.280
Now currently it's going to do is redirect us to chat dot h TNL.

08:48.330 --> 08:51.900
But as you'll see it does indeed pass the data along.

08:51.930 --> 08:58.230
Here we have a name equal to Andrew and we have real name equal to Noad course students just like we

08:58.230 --> 09:01.590
specified over inside of index dot h t.

09:01.590 --> 09:07.620
And now with this in place we are now ready to start talking about how we can join a specific rooms

09:07.860 --> 09:09.410
inside a socket I O.

09:09.510 --> 09:14.190
Making sure the events we emit only go to other people connected to that room.

09:14.220 --> 09:16.530
We have the stuff in place to get this done.

09:16.650 --> 09:20.180
So we're gonna get started with all of that in the next video.

09:20.190 --> 09:22.770
For now we have a pretty great looking joined page.

09:22.770 --> 09:24.960
This is where we can join a room.

09:25.200 --> 09:27.950
Let's wrap this up with a commit committing our changes.

09:28.080 --> 09:31.420
If Iran gets status you're going to see that we have a modified file index.

09:31.480 --> 09:32.450
H TNL.

09:32.520 --> 09:36.730
And that also thinks we deleted index dot J us although we add something down below.

09:36.930 --> 09:43.170
When we run get add dot and rerun get status to understand exactly what happened here you can see we

09:43.170 --> 09:46.030
copied indexed HVM to chat.

09:46.070 --> 09:46.910
HVM.

09:46.990 --> 09:48.500
We then modified index.

09:48.540 --> 09:52.590
H TNL and we renamed index dot J s to chat.

09:52.680 --> 09:53.060
J asked.

09:53.070 --> 09:55.190
Which is exactly what we did.

09:55.200 --> 10:02.390
I'm going to go ahead and actually make the commit using get commit with the M flag and join page that

10:03.570 --> 10:08.200
submits to chat DML.

10:08.380 --> 10:12.070
We can then make the commit push it up to get how and that is it for this one.

10:12.070 --> 10:13.700
I will see you next time
